# What you will find here
This repository contains my solutions to five challenges and one final project for successfully completing the Data Engineer NanoDegree program from Udacity.

WHile the five challenges where somewhat guided and with resources from Udacity, the last 'Capstone' project is quite open-ended in its implementation. An outline, guidelines and criteria are given, but the dataset is free to choose, as well as the architecture, tools and technical solution.

In each of the folders, you will find the references and helpful links to that particular challenge in the README.md, as well as a more detailled description of the challenge / project itself.
